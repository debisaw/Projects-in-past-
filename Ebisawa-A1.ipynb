    "So far, you've learned very important fundamental concepts in Machine Learning such as supervised learning (e.g. classification and regression) vs unsupervised learning (e.g. clustering), overfitting, model evaluation, and performance measures (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, MSE, etc.).

In this assignment, you are going to practice what you've learned so far by building ML models and applying them on data.\n",

Also note that this assignment has three parts and includes multiple steps and questions. You're strongly recommended to get started early and plan to finish well before the due date. Technical problems or other issues/questions on the due date or just a day before would NOT be accepted as an excuse for extension."

    "Debugging the codes and error resolution are ALWAYS the students' responsbility regardless of the source or the cause of the error. This policy will be enforced in email communications and the office hours. Keep in mind that all assignments are individual graded tasks. Any collaboration with other students is strictly prohibited and is considered as cheating. Students should NOT share any answer, solution, or code with other students. Violations of these policies would be penalized according to UMBC academic integrity policy.\n",

    "`...` may indicate one or more lines of missing codes. Some outputs are provided to you to use as reference and to verify that your output is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing Effect on Grade**: Preprocessing steps are so critical in each part and you should pay special attention to make sure that you do all preprocessing steps correctly. That is why the reference outputs have been provided in preprocessing steps. Your notebook would become ineligible for grading implementation parts if you have wrong results/outputs of preprocessing, so be extremely careful with all preprocessing steps. "

XGBoost documentation for [`.fit()`](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html#xgboost.dask.DaskXGBRanker.fit) and [`.predict()`](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html#xgboost.dask.DaskXGBRanker.predict) methods suggests that their usage is similar to sklearn.

    "(a) Based on the criteria mentioned above, I do not believe both rf and xgb classifiers are suited for this problem.\n",
    "Indeed, both accuracy were above 90%, but once it was balanced, accuracy decreased to 50%.  In addition, number of TP was significantly low for both classifier, while FN was high.  This numeric shows that both classifier failed to predict the stroke patient based of the feature provided.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   On the other hand, if we are comparing which classifier was performing better, then XGBoost performend better in my opinion.  RF method had lower recall than XGB.  In this test, RF method only predicted 1 TP and 0 FP.  While XGB precision was lower than RF, the end goal of the machine is to predict whether the patient will have stroke in the future. As a tool, it is better to have a lower threshold to determine if a person is a potential stroke patient so that they can be examined more in details.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) No, I think accuracy is not a good indicator.  In this problem, I believe accuracy seems to be high because of the high number of TN.  But what is striking is the low recall value on both classifier.  Both classifier failed to identify TP.  The machine should have a high recall and precision, since that what it matters to predict potential stroke patients.  If the machine fails to identify potential stroke patients, then this machine looses value as a good measure to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) I believe changing the weight of each feature will improve the result.  For example, the dataset contains feauture such as residence type, work type, and gender, which I am assuming not valuable information compared to age, bmi, glucose level, and smoking status to predict stroke.  If we can weith the latter feauture more than the former feature, I believe the performance will increase. "

    "Next, you're going to tune the hyperparameters of the random forest classifier to check whether it can improve the results. You should use [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) which tries different combinations of hyperparameter values to find the best values. Read the documentation to learn more. There is also an example in Chapter-2 of the textbook (page 76) that you should read. Running this part may take a while (**depending on your computer speed it may take more than an hour**).\n",

    "> `param_grid` argument of `GridSearchCV` is a dictionary that contains the hyperparameters and their corresponding values that you should include in your search. Other than the `param_grid`, you can use the default arguments of `GridSearchCV`. You may want to set `verbose=True` to get more info in the output.\n",

    "\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "No, fine-tuning hyperparameters did not improve the performance of the RF.  One explanation that can be proposed is that the dataset had irelevant features that could have skewed the predicition.  Based of recall and precision value, one can say that the dataset did not have much pattern to the point where the machine were not able to predict stroke patient based on it.  The dataset that we fed in the machine consisted of 10 features, including marriage status and resident status.  Reducing the numbe of total features will increase the weight of each, meaning glucose level and past medical history will have more weight.  Therefore, the machine could have had a better performance if the data did not have irrevent data.  \n",

    "\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "The best way to determine the better performance is to look at the curve that has higher true positive rates at the same false positive rate.  In this case, RF classifier has higher true positive rate at majority of the graph compared to the XGB classifier.  Therefore, RF classifier has a better performance. "

    "\n",
    "ANSWER: \n",
    "Yes, based on the ROC curves and auc scores, both classifier seems to be promising. But, I still do not believe that these classifiers have a good performance.  Based on the precision and recall value computed above, while RF had perfect precision, recall was lower than 5% for both.  In other words, the classifier we have trained failed to predict stroke patients based on the feauture provided.  Therefore, I ROC curve and AUC by itself is not a good indicator for classifier perfomance for this dataset.  "
